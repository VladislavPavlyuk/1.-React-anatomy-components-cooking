        <h2>STEP 4: AIR DRY THE DUCK</h2>        
        
        <p>This process reduces the moisture in the skin thus helping to crisp up while roasting. Put the duck (over a rack and inside a tray) in the fridge without any cover. Keep it there for 24 to 48 hours. You can shorten the process by blowing cool air at the duck with a fan if available.</p>
