        <h2>HOW TO PREPARE THE DUCK?</h2>

        <p>Like making Five Spice Chicken or Aromatic Crispy Duck, youâ€™ll need to prepare the duck in advance to achieve the best taste and texture. For this recipe, start the process 1 to 2 days before cooking. This involves four simple steps.

        <h2>STEP 1: SEASON THE DUCK.</h2>

        <p>Pat dry the duck with kitchen paper to remove any moisture then rub a good layer of fine salt all over (including the cavity). Leave it to rest for about 1 hour over a wire rack inside a tray.</p>
