        <h2>MAKE A SOUP (OPTIONAL)</h2>

        <p>In Peking duck restaurants, waiters usually ask the diners what is their preferred way to cook the duck carcass after the meat has been sliced off. Among a few options, duck carcass soup (鸭架汤) is the most popular choice. In fact, many people would take the carcass home to make the soup later.
        </p>  
        
        <p>Simply simmer the carcass (broken into smaller pieces) in water for 30 mins or so. Add some sliced napa cabbage or winter melon to balance the taste. To make it more substantial, you can also put in some tofu pieces. Add salt and white pepper to season.
        </p>
