        <h2>IMPORTANT NOTES:</h2>
          <li>The cooking time required differs depending on the size of the duck and the performance of the oven. I used a 2.5 kg (5.5lb) duck for this recipe. Please feel free to adjust if necessary.</li>
          <li>The best way to check the doneness is to use an instant-read meat thermometer. Insert its tip into the inner thigh area near the breast. If the temperature reaches 74C°/165F°, the duck is fully cooked.</li>
          <li>If the inside part isn’t cooked yet but the skin has gained the desired colour, turn off the fan of the oven and loosely cover the top of the duck with aluminium foil. Continue cooking for a little longer. This prevents over-browning.</li>
          <li>Make sure your kitchen is well ventilated when you open the oven door as there will be smoke coming out.</li>
